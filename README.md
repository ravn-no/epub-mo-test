# EPUB example file with media overlay

This respository contains a test file with an automatically generated
word-by-word media overlay.

Sources of the original files:

The EPUB was downloaded from the Gutenberg project at
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

The audio book was downloaded from the librevox project at
https://librivox.org/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-by-lewis-carroll/

The automatically created media overlay is far from perfect, but it
illustrates some problems with the current media overlay
implementation of the Readium R2 javascript reader and can be used for
other test purposes.
